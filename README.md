JsCollate
=========

Compresses and collates JavaScript files and updates the HTML file script tags.

It's relatively easy to compress and collate multiple JS files but that's only half the battle. You also need to update the script tags in your HTML file to point to the newly created file. You could do it by hand but that's not very efficient.

JsCollate solves this problem by concatenating all of your JS files, compressing them, and updating the HTML file all in one step. Just what you need to easliy release your single page app.
